# Insert debugging prints

Writing print statements to help you debug sucks. Instead, this pass adds print statements after all of your binary operations to tell you the new value. It was a little tricky because to I add line numbers(So the messages actually make sense) which required sorting through how debug information is stored on LLVM. A bug I encountered was then calling printf on the result of an operation, it would print out the value 255. I found out this is because on it's own, printf is unique in that it won't do type conversions for you. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8303673/why-cast-is-needed-in-printf
